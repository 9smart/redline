		<h2><a href='index.html'>Redline</a></h2>
		<p>Redline is a pure Java library for manipulating <a href='http://www.rpm.org'>RPM Package Manager</a> packages. Currently the project supports reading and creating packages and has an included <a href='http://ant.apache.org'>Ant</a> task useful for integration with build systems. Support for package signatures will be added in a future release.</p>

		<p>Please note that the source distribution build script requires Maven 2 or later. The bundle binary distribution packages all required dependencies in one distributable JAR and contains all classes needed to use Redline in an Ant build script.</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> The source control repository has been switched to <a href='http://git-scm.com/'>Git</a> available at <a href='http://github.com/craigwblake/redline'>our GitHub repostory</a>.</p>
