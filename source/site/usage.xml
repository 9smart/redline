			<h2>Usage</h2>
			<p>There are several tools provided by the Redline package which are useful when working with RPM files. This includes a scanner for examining existing RPM files, a programmatic interface for generating RPM packages, and an Ant task that can be imported and invoked from build scripts in order to package deployment files.</p>

			<h3>Scanner</h3>
			<p>The scanner tool can be invoked from the command line using the main class <span class='code'>org.freecompany.redline.Scanner</span>. From the command line this class accepts as it's single argument a path to a valid RPM file. If the file specified by the providing path does not exist, or if the file in not a valid RPM archive an exception will be thrown. And example of invoking the scanner follows:</p>
			<div class='code'>
				java -cp redline.jar org.freecopany.redline.Scanner test.rpm
			</div>
			<p>The scanner is most useful for debugging RPM files and tools such as Redline as it generates a significant amount of output. For more generalized RPM information the standard RPM tools are recommended.</p>

			<h3>Builder</h3>
			<p>The builder is the main entry point for constructing RPM files programmatically. The tool is used by constructing an instance of the <span class='code'>org.freecompany.redline.Builder</span> class and adding files and headers to the archive. When the builder is completely configured a final call will generate the RPM file to a given <span class='code'>java.nio.channels.FileChannel</span>.</p>
